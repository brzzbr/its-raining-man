# Weather Alert Bot

Well... uhm... this is a telegram bot.

It sends alerts about the weather. I deploy it on my Raspberry Pi.

It implies that some WebDriver-compatible process runs on `4444` to render fancy weather previews. I use this
thing https://github.com/seleniumhq-community/docker-seleniarm.
